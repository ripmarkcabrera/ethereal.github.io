									<p>Mark was born in the Philippines on September 16th.......His family emigrated to the United States in the 1980's. Mark soon became obsessed with music and after getting his first drum kit, he knew he had a mission to fullfill. 
									   Mark spent his time playing with other musicians in high school until he finally decided to start a band with close friends called Overdose. From Overdose, he then moved on to other projects and sessions until he finally landed
									   on his master project, Fatmark. This was the band that truly catapulted Mark into rock star status and was eventually the final band that he ends up being truly a part of. Fatmark is Mark's absolute masterpiece.

									<p><ul>
									<li>Mark loved to cookand he was great at it. Pork belly was one of his best!</li>
									<li>Mark was once pulled over by Burbank police for suspicion only to be let go with a fake ID. The person's photo was a white person.</li>
									<li>He drove his family crazy while learning to play drums as he banged his hands in the back seat of the car non-stop.</li>
									<li>After a long night of partying, Mark went into work, fell asleep on the forklift and ran into the warehouse shelving racks</li>
									<li>Everywhere he went, someone always recognized Mark. But namely, rockstars like Dave Lombardo of Slayer, Ted Aguilar of Death Angel and many others always made sure to catch up with Mark, no matter what. </li>
									<li>In junior high, Mark wanted to look exactly like Prince Be of P.M. Dawn. He got the glasses, jacket and cut his hair. </li>
